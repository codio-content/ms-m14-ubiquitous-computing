The RFID chips just provide data and there is a transponder that needs to read the data. Then what? 

Once a transponder reads the data it can be used and manipulated for any purpose. If the data is a persons medical information, it could be used to make sure they have the correct medicine. If it is in an access card, the data could be used to allow access to only certain doors for an employee or it could track the date and time the person entered or left the building. 

RFID just holds data in a small mobile way that can easily be accessed.  Once the data is accessed any type of computational method can be used on that data.
