## Tracking Data

RFID stands for Radio-Frequency Identification. This refers to small electronic devices that have a small chip and antenna. The chip has unique data to identify whatever it is assigned to or attached to.  RFID tags can be in anything from packages, clothing, devices, etc.  

In a package it can be used to track the package by knowing what that ID is and then getting the GPS of its location.  RFID are used in some museums inside items such as a replica bone that can then be read at a kiosk and give information to the patron about what it is and what animal it came from.  

While RFID just provide data it is the devices reading that data that are increasing computational uses.
