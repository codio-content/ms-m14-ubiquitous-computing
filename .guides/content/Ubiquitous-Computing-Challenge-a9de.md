# Challenge

You will be doing an "OFF-LINE" project.  Your teacher will explain how it is to be turned in. 

# Requirements
 - You will need to research a type of computing system that interests you. This includes computers, cars, smartphones, traffic lights, etc.

 - You will need to analyze the computational components and its capabilities. (Ex: Perhaps you look at an old model car and its newer counterpart. You then look at the difference in computing components and what the car can and cannot do.) 
 
  - You need to present your information in a presentation format. Choose a presentation medium of your choice (Power point, Google slides, Prezi, etc) unless your teacher instructs you otherwise.


*OFF-LINE assignments need turned in to your teacher.*
